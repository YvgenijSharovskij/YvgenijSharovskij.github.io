			<p> Originally developed by James Gosling (c.f. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling">wiki page</a>),
            	Java is the most frequently used programming language in the 
          		world (<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE Index</a>, 2017). Java programs are popular
                for the distinct advantage of being platform-free by first being compiled into bytecode 
                and then executed on the Java Virtual machine (JVM), 
                which can be run on a multitude of systems. </p>
            <br>    
            <p> Android and iOS development is often synonymous with Java programming, and
            	this is also the main subject of the Java projects on this website, with specific focus on 
                Android development, including Android game programming with OpenGL Embedded Systems (ES).

			<p>This section is dedicated to VR projects. Aside from the WebVR <a href="https://jlptn5-kanji.github.io/">N5 Kanji grid</a> site,
				the focus here is primarily on the Oculus Rift VR. The main engine used is the Unity3D engine. 			
				Even though the Unreal Engine tends to produce better graphics than Unity, it is based on
				C++ instead of C#, which makes migration from Android Java relatively more laborious. Moreover, there is a myriad of (free)
				assets with easily implemented boilerplate available for Unity, which is something that UE simply can't compete with.
			</p>
			 <br> 
			<p>Having said that, I might migrate from Oculus Rift with Unity to another HMD and engine. I currently have the
				Oculus Rift CV1 (i.e., commercial version 1), which is getting somewhat dated as it does not integrate FOV rendering, Tobii eye-tracking with improved
				vergence accommodation, inside-out tracking, <em>etc</em>, &#8212; all of which generally results in poor performance and necessitates frequent asynchronous timewarp rending with calculated intermediary frames.

		<article class="container" role="main">
			<p> One of the first books I had picked up on web design started with some JavaScript code to detect if
            	the user browser was NN (Netscape Navigator) or IE (this abbreviation, for the time being, is still used).
                This was a time when most people had not yet heard about AJAX. My only tool for web design was the MS NotePad and 
                all of the coding I did was by hand (technically, both of the hands).
                Several years later I attended web design classes in college, where I encountered Dreamweaver, which
                back then was still owned by Macromedia. And almost immediately after using Dreamweaver, I had just about
                lost interest in web design. The realisation was simple enough: web design could be reduced to
                point-and-click methods, without actually doing any of the coding.
        	</p>
            <br>
            <p> Although point-and-click web design is even more simple now, and I've already made several web sites
            	with WordPress and Adobe Muse, web design has also become more complicated, and hence more interesting.
                Cross-browser compatibility is the subject of thick books; and the advancement of the HTML5 shiv and 
                CSS5 pre-processing with SASS may actually be called programming  (in contrast to "actual programming")
                without forcing the next door Java developer to cringe at the mere thought of it.
                Moreover, OpenGL ES can be run in a browser as WebGL, and easily
                edited in Adobe Animate. And most exciting of all, the availability of cheap VR headsets is catching up
                with the development of WebVR. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> On the other hand, some parts of web design haven barely changed. When I first started coding web sites, I 
            	used relative CSS tables for positioning. Nowadays, grids are used as a standard, ranging from the
                popular <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> to the <a href="http://postcss.org">PostCSS</a>-based 
                <a href="https://github.com/sylvainpolletvillard/postcss-grid-kiss">"grid-kiss"</a> which allows creation 
                of grids with regular keyboard characters (literally, an "ASCII table"). 
                All of this, and more, has re-focused my interest in web design beyond the creative part of it.

			<p> Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is the popular Unix command shell with its roots back in 1989.

			<p> R was released by <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/">R. Ihaka</a> and R. Gentleman 
            	(hence the name of the language) in 2000 under the GNU General Public License. R is a simple
                higher-level programming language intended for numerical analysis and it is most commonly 
                used in statistics. </p>
            <br>    
            <p> As such, R is the open-license competitor of MATLAB (matrix laboratory) from 1970s. Though early in their
                inception, R and MATLAB had some distinct advantages and disadvantages, the difference between R and 
                MATLAB has become blurred over the years, and current user statistics for both MATLAB and R are about the same
                (<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE Index</a>, 2017). </p>
            <br>  
            <p> Note that, while the open-license distributions of R have lead to numerous, highly specific, custom
            	user packages, due to the sheer nature of the R distribution license, it is not uncommon for 
                reports to be rejected from publication in peer-reviewed journals. For this, and other reasons, MATLAB
       			and other alternative statistical methods are to be preferred instead of R.

             	 as defined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/#transform-rendering">transform property</a> itself;
             	 instead, a fixed wrapper for the off-canvas menu was used</li>
        	<li> in some browsers (notably IE) a transform on a fixed wrapper creates an
       		 	 extra 1 px margin of the element as it is translated; to fix this and prevent flickering,
             	 <code class="css-property">backface-visibility:</code> <code class="css-value">hidden</code> was applied on the translated elements</li>
			<li> as <code class="css-property">backface-visibility:</code> <code class="css-value">hidden</code>
        	 	 can cause fonts to appear thinner than usual, anti-aliased
             	 font was used, c.f. _mixins.scss</li>
    	</ul>

    <h3>Cross-browser support:</h3>	
    <div class="bg-about">

    	<ul>
        	<li> IE is the bottleneck and support goes back to IE 9, which has relatively
        	 	 low <a href="http://caniuse.com/usage-table">user statistics</a>, by using 
             	 e.g. translate 2D instead of 3D; improvements would be to use 
                 <a href="https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity">Velocity.js</a>, as in archive.html,
                 as well as  <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a> </li>
                 
            <li> another performance improvement would be to set a threshold timer
                 on function calls in order to either prevent repeated function calls within a short 
                 time-interval (a.k.a. throttling) or to wait for the last function invocation until running
                 it (a.k.a. debouncing); throttling and debouncing are handled differently across the common browsers
                 and even OSs; <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a> provides ready-made
                 throttling, debouncing and other useful functions</li>
        	<li> for simplicity and future development, a 
        	 	 popular <a href="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js polyfill">JavaScript polyfill</a> is loaded 
        	 	 from a CDN; however, the only polyfill used is 
             	 the <a href="https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671">request/cancel AnimationFrame polyfill</a> 
             	 for <code class="css-property">setTimeout()</code> and <code class="css-property">clearTimeout()</code>
            	 by Erik Möller, Paul Irish and Tino Zijdel, 
            	 which is included as comments in the non-minified main.js file</li>
        	<li> instead of using HTML comments such as <code class="code-comment">[if lte IE 8]</code>,
        	 	 a <a href="http://www.browser-update.org">browser updater</a> based on pure-JavaScript is employed</li>
